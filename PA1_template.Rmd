## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r load data}
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- fread("activity.csv")
data$date<-ymd(data$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r steps per day}
byday<- data[, sum(steps), by=date]
setnames(byday, "V1", "totalsteps")
hist(byday$totalsteps)
byday[, .(mean=mean(totalsteps, na.rm=T), median=median(totalsteps, na.rm=T))]

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r average pattern}
avgpattern <- data[, .(meansteps=mean(steps, na.rm=T)), by = interval]
plot(avgpattern$interval, avgpattern$meansteps, type = "l")
avgpattern[meansteps==max(avgpattern$meansteps),]
```



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
